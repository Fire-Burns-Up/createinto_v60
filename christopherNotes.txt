Thanks to Rick
We're Fire Burns Up Inc.
Create interactive installations and occasional site for advertising
We've been around for a long time
Started the company because we were not pleased with the quality of work we were seeing and being asked for
Here are some awards
Here are some brands
Clients - ugh
A problem that we've run into is the $30 problem
Anything can be industrialised
SXSW
Activision had a vinyl wrap Call of Duty black ops on a skeeball machine
Research has shown that selling a high quality product is more sustainable
We're not in a position to make this argument to too many clients
